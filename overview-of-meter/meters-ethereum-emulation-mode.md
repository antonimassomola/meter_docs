# Meter's Ethereum Emulation Mode

In order to better support Ethereum developers, we introduced a full Ethereum emulation mode on Meter.  One could think it as Apple M1 running x86 applications.  Meter's nodes will emulate the runtime environment for Ethereum transactions and smart contracts.  The nodes also supports the Ethereum RPC interface.  Ethereum toolchains, applications and wallets will treat Meter network as one of the Ethereum testnets.  Almost all the Ethereum applications could run Meter with almost no modifications.
